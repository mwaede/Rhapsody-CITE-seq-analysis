For targeted single-cell cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq), the BD Rhapsody platform provided by BD Biosciences was used.
4 samples were multiplexed and run on a single cartridge. 64 samples in total on 16 cartrdiges. Sequencing libraries were sequenced on S4 flow cells on a NovaSeq6000 generating 16 R1 reads and 16 R2 reads (fastq.qz files).
The targeted transcriptomics and AbSeq (antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates) fastq.qz files were processed on SevenBridges (https://www.sevenbrigdes.com) via the standard Rhapsody analysis pipeline (Pipeline Version 2.0) per manufacturers recommendation with AbSeq reference and Targeted reference.
Seurat RDS File outputs were used for analysis.
