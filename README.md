For targeted single-cell cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq), the BD Rhapsody platform provided by BD Biosciences was used.

Targeted transcriptomics and AbSeq FastQ files were processed on SevenBridges (https://www.sevenbrigdes.com) via the standard Rhapsody analysis pipeline (Pipeline Version 2.0) per manufacturers recommendation.
